  "Pure-function market-entry filing-draft + filing-submit record
  construction -- an append-only market-entry book-of-record draft.

  Like every sibling actor's registry, there is no single international
  reference-number standard for a public-procurement market-entry
  filing -- every jurisdiction assigns its own format. This namespace
  does NOT invent one; it builds a jurisdiction-scoped sequence number
  and validates the record's required fields, the same honest,
  non-fabricating discipline `marketentry.facts` uses.

  `engagement-fee-matches-claim?` is an HONEST reapplication of the
  SAME ground-truth-recompute DISCIPLINE sibling actors use (verify a
  claimed monetary total against the entity's own recorded quantity x
  unit fields), reapplied to a market-entry engagement fee line.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real procurement portal or to IRI's register.iri.com.
  It builds the RECORD an operator would keep, not the act of
  submitting a portal registration itself (that is
  `marketentry.operation`'s `:filing/submit`, always human-gated -- see
  README Actuation)."
