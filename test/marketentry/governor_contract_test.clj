(ns marketentry.governor-contract-test
  "The governor contract as executable tests -- this vertical's own
  Trust Controls implemented faithfully. The single invariant under test:

    MarketEntry-LLM never drafts or submits a filing the Market-Entry
    Compliance Governor would reject, `:filing/draft`/`:filing/submit`
    NEVER auto-commit at any phase, `:engagement/intake` MAY auto-commit
    when clean, and every decision (commit OR hold) leaves exactly one
    ledger fact.

  Additionally, this vertical's five new checks are each exercised as
  their own falsifiable fixture:

    1. domestic-track-missing -- an engagement with ONLY an offshore
       IRI registration that claims to bid on a domestic RMI public
       contract is HELD (this vertical's flagship
       disambiguation).
    2. fibl-missing -- foreign investment without a Foreign Investment
       Business License (+ Reserved-List acknowledgement) is HELD.
    3. procurement-basis-stale -- citing the REPEALED 1988 Procurement
       Code instead of the current Procurement Code Act, 2023
       (P.L. 2023-62) is HELD.
    4. gross-revenue-tax-unacknowledged -- a domestically-operating
       engagement that has not acknowledged the gross-revenue-tax
       basis is HELD.
    5. cofa-preference-fabricated -- an engagement that claims a COFA
       procurement-bidding preference is HELD, regardless of the
       bidder's claimed nationality -- the governor never grants a
       bidding advantage on this basis."
